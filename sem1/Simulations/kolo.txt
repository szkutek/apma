1. 
Beta \in [âˆ’1, 1] is called the skewness parameter. In this context the usual skewness is not well defined, as for alpha < 2 the distribution does not admit 2nd or higher moments, and the usual skewness definition is the 3rd central moment.

2.
No, they have to be independent and alpha parameter has to be the same

3.

GCLT 
- 1 < alpha < 2
- uses other distr. with heavy tails, eg. Pareto
- approximation
- summation slows it down and can produce large numbers

CMS algorithm
- 0 < alpha <= 2
- we simulate X~S_alpha (1, beta, 0) and then multiply by sigma and add mu
- different formulas for alpha = 1 and alpha != 1
- uses other distr. - uniform, exponential
- no loops, but lots of calculations of trigonometric functions

Series representation
- 0 < alpha < 2
- truncation of sum from inf to some const M, so approx.
- uses other distr. 
- produces only symmetrical r.v. (beta=0, sigma=0)

4. 

integral (spectral) representation
- approx. 1 - truncated interval from R to [M1, M2]
- approx. 2 - sum instead of integral
- time consuming - lots of calc. on f(s) and ksi_i

series representation
- exact series formula
- approx. - truncated sum from [1,inf) to [1,M)

6. 
(If it's concentrated on a unit sphere, then ) ?
(X1, .., Xd) can be expressed as a linear transformation of independent alpha-stable random variables.

7. - na kartce
it's a symmetric stable vector

8. 
No, only when Sigma (cov. matrix) is positive and symmetric???

9.
Davies and Harte method produces increments.

10. 
positive semi-definite and symmetric.

11.
We have self-similar process with stationary increments with Hurst index H > 0.5. Then it's increments create a stationary long range dependence sequence.

13.
To simulate general Levy process, algorithm for a-stable Levy motion can be extended. We only need to identify the distribution of increments ksi_i.
