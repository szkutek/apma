The company behind Snapchat — an ephemeral photo messaging app that's viral among teens — has presented investors with some unique challenges. It's unclear how exactly the California company plans to make a profit, especially with daily active user growth slowing. Shareholders will also get negligible voting rights with the stock.



Snap makes its money through advertising and will need to convince potential investors that its app is not just a fad.
In 2016, the company generated revenue of $404.5 million, a sixfold increase on the $58.7 million made in 2015.
However, net losses widened to $514.6 million last year, from $372.9 million the year before.

At the end of 2016, Snap had 158 million daily active users, up 48 percent from the same time the year before. But in the fourth quarter of 2016, year-on-year growth of users fell, which Snap put down to increased competition as well as product performance issues stemming from updates to its app.

Snap has seen rising competition from the likes of Facebook, which has released its own Snapchat-like product called "Stories", as well as Instagram Stories, another service akin to the disappearing messaging app.






Reaches 40% of 18-34 year olds in the US.
Revenue: snap ads, lenses, geofilters, spectacles.
